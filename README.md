## PROBLEM STATEMENT  
<p><strong>India is an agriculture based economy with 18% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) coming from different
agricultural products. Due to improper management every year crops of rupees in crores are wasted in India. This
causes huge losses on farmers who produce these crops and also affects the Indian Economy. So this is really
important to find the solution and help in any way possible to prevent wastage by proper management. </strong></p>

<p>The main difficulty present among the Indian Farmers is they don’t opt for the proper crop based on the soil
necessities. As per some estimations, about 55% of the total population of India depends on farming. India stands as
one of the biggest producers of agricultural products and still has very less farm productivity. We need to increase
productivity so that farmers can get more pay from the same piece of land with less labour.  </p>

## <img src="images/lightbulb.png" width='30'> SOLUTION
<p>Cultivo application will propose help to farmers in determining the soil
quality by doing analysis on its various parameters and will suggest crops based on the results obtained
using Machine Learning approach. The system will use different classification algorithms and ensemble techniques in order to obtain an accurate and efficient model. The dataset will help in predicting if a crop is going to be profitable or not depending on various factors.</p>

<p> Cultivo
application based on different factors will help in predicting the right crop to grow in that specific region.This application is intended to provide the solutions to farmers through a
single gateway using the internet. A person just starting up with farming will take time in making good decisions.
So, they can ask any problem they are facing by just putting the question on the website other users will help them by commenting on their queries . Through this
application we aim to provide direct services using the most suitable technologies and comfortable user experience</p>

###
```
The main functions of the website are:
1. Users can predict suitable crops to grow based on soil nature and the region they want to grow crop in.
2. Users can also convert the whole website in their own language. Language is not the barrier here.
3. Farmers can ask any queries by posting questions.
4. Users can edit or delete the question only the one they posted.
5. Users can add solutions to the listed problems.
6. Users can edit and delete the solution they posted.
7. Others can like the solutions posted.
8. Users can register, login and logout.
9. Users can make their profile on the website.
10. Users can also update the profile later if they want.
11. Used SMTP framework to send mail which allow users to reset password.
12. Viewers can see all the schemes for farmers by the government on the dashboard of the website.
13. Admin will have control over the whole application and will have a record of each user.
